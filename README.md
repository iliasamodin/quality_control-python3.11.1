# Quality control
Product quality control 
is a constant process of monitoring the quality indicators of finished products and semi-products, 
correlating these indicators with expected and reference indicators for each specific type of product.

## Quality control website
This repository contains the backend of the site for generating reporting 
based on the quality indicators of iron ore concentrate via the API. 
The project is written in the Django and Django REST frameworks and consists of several API views: 
logging in and out of your account, viewing and changing concentrate composition record, deleting record, 
mass updating concentrate composition records using Excel table data 
and viewing reports on concentrates for different periods.

## Why was this project written
This project is a solution to a test task from Belka Digital.

While developing this project, I practiced working with Django permissions, parsing Excel files 
and programming aggregation functions in Django ORM, 
as well as working with the Swagger tool and the Postman platform.
